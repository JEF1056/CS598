Patient: Yes! I feel constant tingling sensation and a feeling that something is pinching my never. Sometimes it's just so painful.
Doctor: Okay.
Patient: Often I feel like my legs have become like elastic. I feel this tingling sensation is the reason my walking has become slower.

Doctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct?
Patient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me?
Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections.
Patient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems.
Doctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped?
Patient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same.
Doctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's?
Patient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan.
Doctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left.

Doctor: Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today?
Patient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you.
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look. I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct?
Patient: Is that what they're calling my nasal problems?
Doctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways.
Patient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me.
Doctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago?
Patient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.

Doctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses?
Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked!
Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing?
Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop.
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears.
Patient: Sounds good.
Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal.
Patient: That's reassuring.
Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?
Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now.
Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?
Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that.
Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected?
Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse.

Patient: I began having weakness in my right arm, and there was some neck pain too.
Doctor: Okay, when these symptoms began, how did you manage them?
Patient: At first, I went to a chiropractor, but after a while my arm started atrophying, and my right hand felt tight. I couldn't extend all my fingers out.
Doctor: Once you noticed the atrophy and contractures, that's the tightness you were experiencing, how were you treated?
Patient: After that, I went to a neurosurgeon close to my house, and he ordered an, um, C T scan of my neck.
Doctor: Okay, do you have the report of that C T Scan with you today?
Patient: Yes, doctor, I have it right here. They were one on the twenty fifth of September in ninety two.
Doctor: Thank you, okay, this shows an intramedullary lesion at C two three, and an extramedullary lesion at C six seven.
Patient: That means tumor, right?
Doctor: Yes sir. Did you have neck surgery?
Patient: Yeah, I have the op notes right here.
Doctor: Okay, just so you know, you had a C six T one laminectomy, and they decompressed the spinal cord. How did you respond to this surgery?
Patient: Well, honestly, I improved for about three months following the operation, but after that I just got worse and worse.
Doctor: Once your symptoms worsened, what happened?
Patient: Um, I started having this burning sensation on my left side.
Doctor: Did you have any weakness, sir?
Patient: Yeah, I had weakness in both my arms.
Doctor: Was one side worse than the other?

Patient: That's cancer, right? This was all done on September first of nineteen ninety three.
Doctor: Well no, not exactly, it's a benign tumor. After this surgery how were your symptoms?

At that time you also complained of nighttime choking episodes which got less intense over the past many months.
Patient: That's right. I was then scheduled for the overnight sleep study to be evaluated for interruptions in my sleep and here we are today to discuss results.
Doctor: Sure. But first tell me, how is your sleeping routine like?
Patient: It is consistent. I go to bed anytime between nine to ten at night and wake up in the morning around five to six.
Doctor: Are you able to sleep as soon as you go to bed?
Patient: No, it's hard for me to start that sleeping process and then I'm awake in like every one or two hours throughout the night. I keep on tossing and turning throughout the night. I always find my sheets out of order when I wake up.
Doctor: How would you compare your sleep here in the lab and at your home?

Doctor: How do you feel when you wake up in the morning?

Doctor: Did you ever feel that you have difficulty breathing while you are asleep?
Patient: No. But I used to cough a lot in the middle of the night.
Doctor: You said you used to, so it is not anymore?
Patient: Yeah, I haven't been coughing for the last few weeks.
Doctor: How's your daily routine? Do you nap in the daytime?
Patient: I spent a lot of time reading and watching T V. Sometimes I doze off while doing that. Not regular, but I do take nap sometimes in between two to three in afternoon and also in the evening hours.
Doctor: Do you smoke?
Patient: Oh yes, I take around one to two packs of cigarettes each day mainly after dinner.
Doctor: Have you noticed any change in your weight?

Patient: I don't really know. I have balancing problems. I have been to my P C P for this issue a few days ago. I saw her about a week and a half ago because I had another fall. Maybe around late December since today is January seventh. I have been having trouble with my right hand. It is like I am clumsy on my right side. I ended up falling because my right hand missed the railing when I grabbed it to head up the stairs.
Doctor: Are you left or right handed?
Patient: Right.
Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit more about the trouble that you are having with the right hand? Is it localized to the right hand?

Guest_family: We noticed it the week prior to Thanksgiving last year in nineteen ninety four. We have a family tradition where we play a game and this time, we were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play ""Murder She Wrote"" at one of our family gatherings. She was chosen to be the assassin.
Doctor: Okay.
Guest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different.
Doctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations.
Guest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game.
Doctor: Was she slurring?
Guest_family: Nope.
Doctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness?
Guest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed.
Doctor: How was it after returning from there?
Guest_family: She returned to work. She used to work in a local florist shop. She returned on the Monday following Thanksgiving. And she had difficulty.
Patient: I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register.

Doctor: What did you notice as far as symptoms?
Patient: Suddenly, I started having double vision.
Doctor: Did the double vision happen more than one time?

Doctor: Did you ever receive any treatment for your binocular diplopia?
Patient: No. It spontaneously resolved and so I didn't need to seek any treatment. Back when all this was happening it had two episodes of a drooping eyelid. I thought I had myasthenia gravis but I was told that that was probably not the case.

Doctor: Good afternoon, sir. Is this your mother?
Patient: Good afternoon, doctor. Yes, this is my mom.
Doctor: Great, please, give me some background information on your history.
Patient: Well, I used to live here in the city when I went to college, but I wanted to get away from a bad crowd, so I came back to live with my mom.
Doctor: What do you mean, bad crowd?
Patient: Well, I got addicted to drugs out there, and I used to inject heroin.
Doctor: Did you see a doctor for this addiction?
Patient: Yeah, I saw another doctor in the city.
Doctor: How did they treat you at that time?
Patient: They prescribed me methadone for a while.
Doctor: Did that help at all?

Doctor: Do you remember the dosage that you were given?
Patient: Um, it was ten M G.
Doctor: How long did you take methadone for?
Patient: Um, it was for three or four months.

Doctor: There's some bleeding in the bone there, but nothing is broken or out of alignment.
Patient: Oh, thank you, that's good.
Doctor: Oh certainly, yes, it is. What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery?
Patient: I've done a full course of PT for this.
Doctor: Where is your knee pain?
Patient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside.
Doctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all?
Patient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur?
Doctor: Yes, that's the femur.
Patient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too.
Doctor: Does it go into your thigh at all?
Patient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there.
Doctor: Do you feel anything in the feet?
Patient: Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully.
Doctor: Are you having any back pain?
Patient: A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related.
Doctor: Does anything make your knee pain worse?
Patient: Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad.
Doctor: What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this?
Patient: I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up.
Doctor: That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?
Patient: Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there.
Doctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?
Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there.
Doctor: What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?

Doctor: Is there any instability?
Patient: Yes, and there's pain with it too.
Doctor: Are you working right now?
Patient: No, I'm not right now.
Doctor: Any allergies I should know about?
Patient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications.
Doctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?
Patient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain.
Doctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain?
Patient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting.
Doctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night?
Patient: Yeah, it does occasionally.
Doctor: Does anything make this feel better?
Patient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated.
Doctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average?
Patient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too.
Doctor: What about at its worst?
Patient: Easily, its ten out of ten.

Doctor: Hello, Nurse. Could you give me a run down on the eleven month old patient?
Guest_clinician: The patient was presented with stage two neuroblastoma on the left when he was six weeks old. It was completely resected. It was shown not to be N Myc amplified and had some favorable Shimada histology.
Doctor: Great. Did he have a follow up after?
Guest_clinician: He did. There was a second primary in his right adrenal gland. They performed a biopsy, which was consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology.
Doctor: Did he receive any chemotherapy?
Guest_clinician: He is now being treated with it per protocol P nine six four one and not on study. His last chemotherapy appointment was on May twenty first two thousand and seven. They used carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.
Doctor: What did they do after chemotherapy?

Patient: I'm twenty five years old.
Doctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?
Doctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific.
Doctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it?
Doctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?
Patient: Yeah, that's correct.
Doctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X?
Doctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.
Doctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture?
Doctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am?
Patient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.
Doctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions?
Doctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw.
Doctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct?
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked.
Doctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis.
Doctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests?
Doctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased.
Doctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found?
Doctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit.
Doctor: Could you explain what it says?
Doctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis.
Doctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right?
Doctor_2: That is correct.
Doctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that?
Doctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative.
Doctor: What lupus serologies were used?
Doctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used.
Doctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look?
Doctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten.
Doctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report?
Doctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested.
Doctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern.
Doctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum.
Doctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?
Doctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid.
Doctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?
Doctor_2: That's correct.
Doctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am?
Patient: I tried my best to.
Doctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X?
Doctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.
Doctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?
Doctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report.
Doctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this?
Doctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically.
Doctor: Nothing was seen microscopically?
Doctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils.
Doctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance.
Patient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States.
Doctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?
Doctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else.
Doctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit?
Doctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time.
Doctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?
Doctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects.
Doctor: What was she places on after?

Doctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that?
Doctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative.
Doctor: What lupus serologies were used?
Doctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used.
Doctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look?
Doctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten.

Doctor: Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?
Patient: I'm twenty five years old.
Doctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?
Doctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific.
Doctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it?
Doctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?
Patient: Yeah, that's correct.
Doctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X?
Doctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.
Doctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture?
Doctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am?
Patient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.
Doctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions?
Doctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw.
Doctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct?
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked.
Doctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis.
Doctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests?
Doctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased.
Doctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found?
Doctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit.
Doctor: Could you explain what it says?
Doctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis.

Doctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern.
Doctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum.

Doctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.
Doctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?
Doctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report.
Doctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this?
Doctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically.
Doctor: Nothing was seen microscopically?
Doctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils.
Doctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance.

Doctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?
Doctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else.
