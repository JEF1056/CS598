Doctor: How long has this been happening for?
Patient: Um. I guess the same amount of time.
Doctor: The same amount of time as your feet?
Patient: Yes. A year or two. I wasn't always this bad. It has been getting worse this whole time.
Doctor: So, it has been getting worse with time.

Doctor: Happy belated birthday! I see that you recently turned sixty two years old.
Patient: Thank you so much. I appreciate the birthday wishes.
Doctor: You're very welcome. I have a few questions to ask before we begin. Are you right or left handed?
Patient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left.
Doctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?
Patient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties.
Doctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?
Patient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.
Doctor: When did you switch?
Patient: Within the last ten years or so.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement?
Patient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors.
Doctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?
Patient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.
Doctor: Do you have any voice tremors?
Patient: I do.
Doctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?
Patient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.
Doctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?
